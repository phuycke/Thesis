    "To create a simulation of a participant performing a simple [Stroop task][Stroop].  \n",

    "The mechanism where weights between the input units and the output units in a connectionist model are altered during learning.  \n",
    "Specifically, the weights between the layers are altered when the output of the model differs from the expected / desired output (i.e. when the model is wrong = saying '**green**' when it should have been '**red**').  \n",
    "Thus, RW learning is an instance of supervised learning. The idea is that these weight alterations will lead to an improvement when it comes to performance (the weights are altered using the provided feedback). Thus, more learning experience will lead to more 'robust' weight changes (weight changes that make sense).  \n",

    "`Binding by random bursts`:  \n",
    "In short, synchrony between two different brain areas / processing areas can be achieved by a random theta frequency-locked neural burst that is sent to both areas. The choice of areas that receive this burst is determined by lateral frontal cortex (thus functioning as a controller in this case). As a result of this synchrony, communication between the two areas becomes more efficient. The conclusion here is that this improved communcation between brain areas will also lead to better performance when task-relevant brain areas become synchronised due to these random bursts.  \n",
